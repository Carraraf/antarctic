# Hi, you may call me Carrara.

I'm an Environmental Engineering student and here I'll share my projects related with Antarctic, hoping it help you (us) to understand better the behavior of water, waves and its physics.

As part of a project to study the Antarctic region, this repository will be used to allocate and monitor the process and evolution of the events under analysis.

Also believing that these codes improve your (our) relationship with python language. Please, use it with discernment and enjoy your JOURNEY.
